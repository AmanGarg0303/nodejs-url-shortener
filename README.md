It is a URL-Shortener nodejs app. It takes a URL and then return the short url, after that we can request on shortURL and redirect the user to the actual user.

Do `npm i` in terminal to install node_modules.

Then do `npm start` in terminal.

Use Postman or ThunderClient to check the API requests and response.

We can also see the tiny urls and redirectUrls in localhost `http://localhost:8000/home`
